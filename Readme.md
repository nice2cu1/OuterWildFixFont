The mod fixes the problem that most of the Chinese-inclusive story mod text is incomplete by replacing the fonts of some interfaces.

It can be used to repair the Chinese translation of all stories of Outer Wilds.

This patch is to solve the problem of incomplete fonts of Outer Wilds' self-made translation in the Chinese environment.

The font of the character dialog box and the Nomai text translator have been replaced, so that the missing text can be displayed normally in the Chinese environment.

The font fragmentation caused by too much log information was fixed by modifying the font size of the spacecraft log (only exists in Chinese)
